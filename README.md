# TICDM
TICDM is a framework for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA), where both textual and visual modalities are used to extract aspects and predict their sentiment polarity from text-image pairs.

Our proposed approach reframes MABSA as a noisy aspect boundary denoising process using a text-image conditioned diffusion model. This leads to more accurate aspect boundary localization and sentiment prediction. The method also integrates image captions to improve the semantic representation of the text.

Highlights:

1. We propose TICDM, the first diffusion model for Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis.

2. Our model effectively fuses multi-grained image and text information.

3. TICDM achieves state-of-the-art results on Twitter-2015 and performs competitively on Twitter-2017.
   
4. TICDM offers flexible control over inference speed and performance by adjusting denoising steps.

We will gradually improve the codebase in the future. We plan to upload more comprehensive project materials, so please stay tuned for updates.
